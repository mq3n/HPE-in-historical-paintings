## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The notebooks uses MMPose toolbox. MMPose is an open-source toolbox for pose estimation based on PyTorch.
It is a part of the [OpenMMLab project](https://github.com/open-mmlab).

To get it ready, follow installation instruction on https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose

## Preparing paintings

To start experiments, you have to download historical paintings. 

For our experiments, we have used the [National Gallery of Art](https://www.nga.gov/collection-search-result.html) collection. The works are cataloged and it's easy to set a filter for the selected era. Thanks to the [open access policy](https://www.nga.gov/notices/open-access-policy.html), the collection can be used in your own research.

We have downloaded 6 collections and named them accordingly: 'gothic','renaissance','baroque','rococo','classicism','romantic'. The images of each collection have been saved to the correct subdirectory in data/paintings/

## Directory Structure

 - **src/**: The jupyter notebook code. You can find detailed description inside notebook in markdown cells.
 - **data/**: 
    - **json/**: Calculated body proportion for each architecture. 
    - **paintings/**: Directiry where historical paintings should by downloaded.
